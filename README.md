    „Äå # VibeOn Edu

The "VibeOn Edu" platform is the first of its kind in the country, offering financial education tailored to young people. It aims to foster better financial literacy and awareness through interactive courses, quizzes, and savings tools.

## The Goal

The primary goal of "VibeOn Edu" is to provide a comprehensive, engaging platform for users to learn about financial literacy. By offering tools such as quizzes, savings calculators, and lecture series, we help users take control of their financial future.

## Features

### User Authentication

- **Sign In**: Users can sign in with their credentials.
- **Register**: New users can create an account to access the platform.
- **Sign Out**: Securely sign out of the platform.

### Savings Calculator

- **Calculate Savings**: Based on users' income and expenses, the calculator provides a roadmap for how much money they need to save to reach their financial goals.

### Quizzes

- **Interactive Quizzes**: Users can take quizzes to test their financial knowledge.
- **Earn Certificates**: By completing quizzes and earning points, users can receive certificates as rewards for their progress.

### Lectures

- **Courses & Lessons**: Users can access various financial education courses and lessons. The lessons are dynamically implemented using data from a `db.json` file I created, which stores the course details, lesson descriptions, and relevant materials.

## Hackathon Project

This project was developed during a hackathon with a team of 14 colleagues. I worked alongside another front-end developer to bring the platform to life. The design was created in Figma, and we collaborated closely with the backend team to fully implement the platform's features.

### My Contributions:

- **Homepage Design**: Worked on the homepage layout and design.
- **User Authentication**: Fully implemented sign in, register, and sign out design and functionality with backend integration.
- **Savings Calculator**: Developed the tool for calculating savings based on user inputs (income and expenses).
- **Quiz Feature**: Implemented quizzes where users can earn points and receive certificates.
- **Courses & Lessons**: Implemented the lessons feature by creating a `db.json` file that stores lesson data and dynamically fetches the content.
- **Bug Fixes**: Collaborated with the team to resolve bugs and ensure smooth functionality.
