<h1 align="center"> HACKATHON 02 - LARGER.WORLD </h1>
## Overview

The **Larger.World** website introduces users to the concept of unlearning and its impact on creating a more sustainable and inclusive world. The design and content are aimed at inspiring users to explore the platform's resources and join the community. Rounded visual elements, inspired by the logo, were used to maintain compliance with brand guidelines.

## Team Collaboration

This project was a collaborative effort by a group of four front-end developers, including myself. Together, we worked on different aspects of the website to ensure a seamless and engaging user experience. **We won the Hackathon** with our project 'Larger.world.'


## My Contribution

I was responsible for:

- **Database Creation:** Developed the database for the podcast, article, and video pages, ensuring that the data structure met the project‚Äôs requirements.
- **Feature Implementation:** Implemented features for the article, podcast, and video pages, allowing users to browse and interact with the content.

## Features

- **Podcast Section:**

  - Browse and listen to various podcasts related to sustainability and inclusiveness.
  - Access podcast descriptions and view the related resources.

- **Article Section:**

  - Read articles that encourage users to rethink traditional practices and explore unlearning.
  - Comment and share insights on articles.

- **Video Section:**
  - Watch videos that align with the platform‚Äôs mission of promoting a better world through unlearning.
  - Comment on videos to engage with the community.

## Starting the Server

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure all dependencies are installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server:**
   Use the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Run the JSON Server:**
   To run the JSON server for the database, use this command:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json --port 5000
   ```
   The application will now be accessible locally at http://localhost:3000 and the JSON server at http://localhost:5000.
